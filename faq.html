                There is a risk involved with investing in all high yield investment programs. However,
                there are a few simple ways that can help you to reduce the risk of losing more than
                you can afford to. First, align your investments with your financial goals,
                in other words, keep the money you may need for the short-term out of more aggressive
                investments, reserving those investment funds for the money you intend to raise
                over the long-term. It's very important for you to know that we are real traders
                and that we invest members' funds on major investments. <br>

                be frozen. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Can I spend with any other e-currency besides Bitcoin?</b><br>
